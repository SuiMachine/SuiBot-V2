<img align="right" src="suibot_win.png" />

SuiBot-V2 is a successor to [SuiBot_Console](https://github.com/SuiMachine/SuiBot_Console) written pretty much entirely from scratch, using many elements that I have learnt over the years. It can run on both Windows and Linux (including Raspberry Pi). For more informations check out [wiki](https://github.com/SuiMachine/SuiBot-V2/wiki).
